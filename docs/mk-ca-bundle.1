.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mk-ca-bundle
.Nd convert mozilla's certdata.txt to PEM format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bilnqtuv
[outputfile]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool downloads the certdata.txt file from Mozilla's source tree over HTTP,
then parses certdata.txt and extracts CA Root Certificates into PEM format.
These are then processed with the OpenSSL commandline tool to produce the
final ca-bundle file.

The default \fIoutputfile\fP name is \fBca-bundle.crt\fP. By setting it to '-'
(a single dash) you will get the output sent to STDOUT instead of a file.

The PEM format this scripts uses for output makes the result readily available
for use by just about all OpenSSL or GnuTLS powered applications, such as
curl, wget and more.

.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width _h
