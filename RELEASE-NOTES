 o when sending a request and an error is received before the (entire) request
   body is sent, stop sending the request and close the connection after
   having received the entire response. This is equally true if an Expect:
   100-continue header was used.
 o When using both -J and a single -O with multiple URLs, a missing init
   could cause a segfault
 o -J fixed for escaped quotes

 o progress: reset flags at transfer start to avoid wrong 
   CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
 o curl_gssapi: Guard files with HAVE_GSSAPI and rename private header
 o silence picky compilers: mark unused parameters
 o help output: more gnu like output
 o libtests: stop checking for CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
 o setting a non-HTTP proxy with an environment variable or with CURLOPT_PROXY
   / --proxy (without specifying CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE) would still make it do
   proxy-like HTTP requests
 o
